Definitions.\n        \n        \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n        \n        \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\n        \n        \"You\" refers to the licensee, whether an individual or organization.\n        \n        \"Modify\" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion\n        requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.\n        \n        1. Source Code.\n        \n        The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n        modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n        \n        2. Basic Permissions.\n        \n        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright\n        on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.\n        This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\n        Program.\n        \n        3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n        \n        No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\n        under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\n        copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\n        restricting circumvention of such measures.\n        \n        4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n        \n        You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,\n        in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on\n        each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating\n        that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7\n        apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\n        and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n        \n        5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n        \n        You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce\n        it from the Program, in source code form under the terms of section 4,\n        provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n        \n        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and\n           giving a relevant date.\n        \n        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\n           this License and any conditions added under section 7.\n        \n        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\n           anyone who comes into possession of a copy.\n        \n        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate\n           Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do\n           not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n        \n        6. Copyleft.\n        \n        If you convey a covered work, you must also make the Corresponding Source\n        available under the same license terms. This ensures that all derivative\n        works remain free and open source.\n        \n        For more information, visit: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\n        \n        ================================================================================\n        \n        GRNexus - High-Performance Neural Network Library\n        Copyright (C) 2024 GR Code Digital Solutions\n        \n        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
